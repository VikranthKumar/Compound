App Entry Point - CompoundApp

APIs - I have created 3 mock APIs (Accounts and Holdings remain the same for all advisors for now for the sake of convenience since I am using mock APIs)
 
The app is designed to handle real-world dynamic data (ids are being passed to Network layer/API calls - uncomment queryItems in Network -> NetworkRequest, Will add pagination in the real world scenario).

Layers/Components are named straightforward (Data, Network, Views, etc)
